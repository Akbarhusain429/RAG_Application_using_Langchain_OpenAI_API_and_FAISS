***LANGCHIN WITH OPENAI AND FAISS:***

LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS are key components frequently used together to build powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. 

**LangChain** is an open-source framework used to simplify the creation of applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides the structure and integrations to connect different components, such as models, data sources, and vector stores.

**OpenAI** provides the language models (e.g., GPT-3.5/4o) for understanding queries and generating responses, as well as embedding models for converting text into dense vector representations (embeddings).

**FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is an open-source library for efficient similarity search and clustering of these dense vectors. It is used as a local vector store to quickly find semantically relevant document chunks based on a user's query.
